;;; Commentary:
;;
;;   When making demonstrations of new products, technologies and other
;;   geekery, I love the versatility of using Emacs to demonstrate the
;;   trifecta of sprint reviews, including:
;;
;;   - Presentations explaining the technologies
;;   - Source code ... correctly highlighted
;;   - Executing the code in Eshell ... or similar demonstration
;;   - Test a new feature
;;
;;   However, I don't want to fat-finger, mentally burp, or even delay
;;   the gratification while I type, so I predefine each "step" as an
;;   Elisp function or keyboard macro, and then have =demo-it= execute
;;   each function when I hit either the SPACE key or the F12 key
;;   (advanced minor mode).
;;
;;   Using the library is a four step process:
;;
;;   1. Load the library in your own Elisp source code file
;;   2. Create a collection of functions that "do things".
;;   3. Create the ordered list of functions/steps with `demo-it-create'
;;   4. Start the demonstration with `demo-it-start'
;;
;;   For instance:
;;
;;       (require 'demo-it)   ;; Load this library of functions
;;
;;       (defun dit-load-source-code ()
;;         "Load some source code in a side window."
;;         (demo-it-presentation-advance)
;;         (demo-it-load-fancy-file "example.py" :line 5 12 :side))
;;
;;       (defun dit-run-code ()
;;         "Execute our source code in an Eshell buffer."
;;         ;; Close other windows and advance the presentation:
;;         (demo-it-presentation-return)
;;         (demo-it-start-shell)
;;         (demo-it-run-in-shell "python example.py Snoopy"))
;;
;;       (demo-it-create :single-window :insert-slow :full-screen
;;                       (demo-it-title-screen "example-title.org")
;;                       (demo-it-presentation "example.org")
;;                        dit-load-source-code
;;                        dit-run-code
;;                       (demo-it-run-in-shell "exit" nil :instant))
;;
;;       (demo-it-start)
;;
;;   Each "step" is a series of Elisp functions that "do things".
;;   While this package has a collection of helping functions, the steps
;;   can use any Elisp command to show off a feature.
;;
;;   I recommend installing these other Emacs packages:
;;
;;   - https://github.com/takaxp/org-tree-slide
;;   - https://github.com/sabof/org-bullets
;;   - https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el
;;   - https://github.com/Bruce-Connor/fancy-narrow
;;
;;   See http://github.com/howardabrams/demo-it for more details and
;;   better examples.  You will want to walk through the source code
;;   for all the utility functions.
;;
;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)

;; Predefined necessary external functions:
(defvar org-image-actual-width)

;; And functions from other projects I like to use...
(declare-function eshell-send-input "ext:eshell")
(declare-function show-all "ext:eshell.c")

;; Load our 'modules' from other files:
(require 'demo-it-custom)

;; And specify the customization variables set in that module:
(defvar demo-it--shell-or-eshell)
(defvar demo-it--keymap-mode-style)
(defvar demo-it--insert-text-speed)
(defvar demo-it--open-windows)
(defvar demo-it--open-windows-size)
